Install ODE before trying to use this mrbgem:

Latest release: None yet, check back later.

As ODE is a C++ library, the easiest way to link mruby with it is to use a C++ compiler instead of a C compiler in your mruby build configuration. I am personally not very experienced in this area, so any information which would facilitate using a simple C compiler to link would help immensely!
